# C-CodeExamples
Small projects I've written in C++
They are...
1. A physics tech demo that uses SDL2 to render particles to the screen with textures on them. This physics demo models gravity, the doppler effect, and elastic collisions between particles.
2. A c++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life
3. A compiler for a made-up language called "Crazy" that uses only the characters +-><:.{}
4. An implementation of a genetic algorithm that attempts to construct a word from random characters.
